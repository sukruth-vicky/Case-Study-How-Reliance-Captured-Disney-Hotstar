Summary: Reliance vs Disney+ Hotstar  

Disney+ Hotstar rose to the top of India’s OTT market with a dual revenue model:  
- Ads from free cricket viewers  
- Subscriptions from premium users  

At its peak, it had over 150M monthly active users.  

In 2023, Reliance disrupted the space by streaming IPL for free on JioCinema. This shifted both users and advertisers, leaving Hotstar vulnerable.  

By 2024, Disney merged its India business with Reliance in an $8.5B deal. The platforms integrated in 2025 to form JioHotstar, combining cricket, Bollywood, regional shows, and Disney’s global catalog.  

Key Insight: Hotstar’s reliance on cricket created success but also risk. Reliance exploited this with bold timing, proving local advantage and disruption can outweigh global scale.
