Case Study: How Reliance Captured Disney+ Hotstar  

Introduction

Disney+ Hotstar was once the undisputed champion of India’s OTT space. It built its empire on the foundation of cricket streaming and Disney’s global content. Yet, within a short span, Reliance managed to disrupt this dominance and eventually take control. This case study explores that journey from Hotstar’s rise to its eventual merger with Reliance and draws lessons for businesses worldwide.

Hotstar’s Meteoric Rise  
Hotstar entered the market at a time when smartphone adoption and cheap data were exploding in India, thanks in part to Reliance Jio’s disruptive telecom strategy. The timing was perfect.  

The platform bet heavily on live sports, especially the Indian Premier League (IPL). Cricket is not just a sport in India, but a cultural phenomenon. By acquiring digital streaming rights, Hotstar captured the loyalty of millions.  

Its business model was built on two powerful pillars:  
1. Ad-supported free users: By offering cricket and shows for free with ads, Hotstar attracted massive audiences. This ad revenue became a steady and highly scalable source of income.  
2. Premium subscribers: For users who wanted ad-free viewing and Disney’s international catalog, a subscription model provided recurring revenue.  

This dual approach worked wonders. Hotstar reached over 150 million monthly active users at its peak, becoming India’s largest OTT platform and a global case study in scaling digital entertainment.  

The Reliance Disruption: Free IPL Streaming  
The turning point came in 2023. Reliance, through JioCinema, announced that IPL streaming would be completely free.  

This was not just a pricing strategy. It was a calculated disruption:  
- Cricket fans who once paid or tolerated ads on Hotstar now flocked to JioCinema.  
- Advertisers, chasing user eyeballs, redirected their budgets.  
- Hotstar’s premium subscribers began questioning the value of their payments.  

In just one season, Reliance managed to flip the market dynamics. Hotstar’s biggest strength exclusive cricket rights turned into its Achilles’ heel.  

Disney’s Struggles in India  
Globally, Disney thrives on its iconic brands, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars. But in India, the consumer mindset was different. Here, affordability and live cricket mattered more than global franchises.  

Disney underestimated how price-sensitive the Indian market is. Its reliance on premium subscriptions could not sustain without cricket, as Indian audiences rarely pay high fees for international content alone.  

The result: Disney+ Hotstar began losing both users and advertisers, leading to a sharp decline in market dominance.  

The 8.5 Billion Dollar Merger  
By 2024, circumstances forced Disney to merge its Indian business with Reliance in a deal valued at 8.5 billion dollars. Reliance gained a controlling stake, effectively taking charge of India’s largest OTT platform.  

In 2025, the two platforms merged into JioHotstar, which brought together:  
- IPL and other cricket tournaments  
- Bollywood blockbusters and regional cinema  
- Disney’s global content library  

This merger created a single, unified OTT giant that combined Reliance’s local strength with Disney’s international appeal.  

Key Takeaways  
1. Cricket was Hotstar’s greatest strength but also its biggest vulnerability. When Reliance made IPL free, Hotstar’s business model collapsed.  
2. Disruption doesn’t always need complexity. A single, bold decision free IPL streaming shifted the balance of power in the entire industry.  
3. Local advantage matters more than global scale in emerging markets. Disney’s global content couldn’t compete with Reliance’s local understanding of what Indian audiences value.  
4. Overdependence on one growth engine is dangerous. Hotstar relied too much on cricket without diversifying effectively.  
5. Timing is everything. Reliance struck when Disney was vulnerable, ensuring maximum impact.  

Lessons for Businesses  
- Understand the local market. Success in India requires different strategies than in the US or Europe.  
- Price sensitivity drives choices. Free or affordable access will always win mass adoption in markets like India.  
- Bold moves pay off. Reliance’s decision to make IPL free was risky but visionary.  
- Disruption reshapes industries. Even global giants can be humbled if a challenger understands the consumer better.  

Conclusion  
The story of Reliance and Disney+ Hotstar is more than a business deal. It is a lesson in timing, strategy, and local advantage. Hotstar rose by capturing cricket and building dual revenue streams, but its overreliance on one pillar left it exposed. Reliance exploited this vulnerability, turning the tables with a single bold move.  

Today, JioHotstar stands as a symbol of how local giants can outmaneuver global players in emerging markets. For businesses, the case serves as a reminder: disruption doesn’t always come from complex strategies. Sometimes, it comes from understanding people better and making the right move at the right time.
