Case Study: How Reliance Captured Disney+ Hotstar  

This repository presents a detailed case study on how Reliance disrupted and eventually took control of Disney+ Hotstar, once the leader of India’s OTT market.  

Overview  
Disney+ Hotstar became a household name by securing exclusive cricket rights and building a strong dual revenue model:  
- Ad-supported free users → massive reach and ad revenue.  
- Premium subscribers → steady income from ad-free viewing and Disney’s global catalog.  

At its peak, Hotstar was India’s biggest streaming platform with 150+ million monthly active users.  

The Disruption  
Reliance, through JioCinema, shook the market in 2023 by offering free IPL streaming. This single move:  
- Drew millions of users away from Hotstar.  
- Redirected advertisers to JioCinema.  
- Weakened Hotstar’s subscription base.  

The Merger  
By 2024, Disney merged its Indian business with Reliance in an $8.5 billion deal, giving Reliance a controlling stake. By 2025, the two platforms merged into JioHotstar, creating a single destination for cricket, Bollywood, regional shows, and Disney’s global catalog.  

Key Takeaways  
- Hotstar rose on cricket but was overdependent on it.  
- Free IPL streaming proved to be the ultimate disruption.  
- Timing and local strategy helped Reliance outmaneuver Disney.  
- Local advantage beats global scale in price-sensitive markets.
